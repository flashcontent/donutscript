## What is?

DonutScript is a scripting programming language used to make games and applications that can compile to Java and HTML5. Uses LWJGL for graphics and ANTLR v4 for language generation.
DonutScript is used in FlashContent projects, like [Actbit](https://github.com/flashcontent/actbit)

## Building

You will need a JDK distribution (like Adoptium or OpenJDK).

Just run the compile.sh (If use Shell Script) or compile.bat (If use Batch)
After building, will create two JAR files, one named 'donut.jar' ane other 'dsc.jar'

## Learning

Now, there's nothing for learning DonutScript. But we are creating DonutScript Wiki for learning, that is not avalible.
